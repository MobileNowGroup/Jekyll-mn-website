#### Mission

With the WPP group of companies moving to a new campus location in Shanghai, the team wanted to ensure that both visitors and staff had no problem finding the new location.

At the campus itself, there should also be relevant help for visitors and staff alike.

#### Concept

For visitors, the _Our Campus_ offers users help on navigating the best route to Hengfeng Rd. 

Once on campus, users are also able to access information on each WPP company and which floor they are located on. iBeacon technology allows companies to then personalise in app welcome messages for their guests.

Staff are just as important users of the app. Nearby outlets that will help meet that where to go for lunch dilemma are also included, as well as other useful amenities such as dry cleaning. This feature will evolve into a WPP deal directory in the next version of the app.

A 'Gallery' of news about the building, as well as a welcome message from Sir Martin Sorrell is also included. Staff can share feedback and suggestions on the building via a 'Talk to Us' feature.

The _Our Campus_ app is also a knowledge sharing platform, allowing users to share news or announcements to the WPP Shanghai community.

The app is powered by a customised CMS, ensuring the app stays as dynamic as it's visitors and staff.

#### Results

The bilingual app was ready for the move in Q415 and downloads have already exceeded expectation.
