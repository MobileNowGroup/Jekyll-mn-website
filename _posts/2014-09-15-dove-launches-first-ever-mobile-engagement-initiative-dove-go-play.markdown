_Dove Go Play_ allows on the go users to easily snap pictures of their hairstyle, via their phones and upload it immediately to the responsive site.

The campaign site delivers dynamic, daily content covering tutorials on how to create the model's hairstyle of that day, as well as complementary Dove hair care tips.

_Dove Go Play_ helps educate users, encouraging them to learn to play with their hair in any way they want, whilst still keeping their locks in tip top condition.

Everyday, ten lucky users are selected that manage to style their hair closest to the model; with one overall winner featured in the December 2014 issue of _Marie Claire_.
