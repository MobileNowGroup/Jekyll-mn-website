Heineken recently launched their Original Sound Experiment in tandem with their famed Green Room events across Asia. Guests experience music with all their senses, with the app giving them everything they need to be at the center of an original sound experiment, and ultimately find out how they saw music.

The app counts down to the spectacular Heineken Moment with other guests, allows users to experiment with special filters and beam photos to the Orb installation high above the dance floor. Revelers can the relive their night through a unique Data Selfie when it unlocks the day after an event.
