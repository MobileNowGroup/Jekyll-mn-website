Welcoming the Chinese tourist is now a top priority for popular tourist destinations around the world. This is no truer than in France, which hosts the most visitors each year.

Palace of Versailles and their partner Talents Travel, knew that a rich and immersive WeChat account would be welcomed by their Chinese visitors.

A customisable CMS was built to allow Talents Travel to publish a wide range of ongoing articles on Palace of Versailles, as well as create a broad media library to populate the WeChat front end.

A wide range of auto reply logic was also created, to allow users to interact on the account. Finally access to account subscriber user data was also made available, so that Palace of Versailles could better understand their visitors.
