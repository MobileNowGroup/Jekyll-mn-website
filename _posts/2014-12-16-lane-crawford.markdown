Lane Crawford has just launched a WeChat Service Account with a completely customised CMS.

WeChat followers can now enjoy tailor made features including a store locator, as well as stay up to date on the latest collections for men and women.

The bespoke CMS enables Lane Crawford to update content as frequently as they wish, ideal in the fast moving world of fashion.

The platform's tracking abilities allow the iconic Hong Kong retailer to better understand their customer's behaviour, honing future communications accordingly.

The account has also been primed for full POS integration and ecommerce enablement, via Ten Pay.
