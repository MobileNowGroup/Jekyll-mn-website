After recently opening it's flagship store in Shanghai earlier this year, Michael Kors together with JWT Shanghai, turned to mobile to showcase it's _Jet Set Experience_ to fashionistas in China and around the world.

The Fashion Show took place on 9 May, with content from the show made immediately available to fans on a customised WeChat channel.

For those not able to make it to the show, the event was captured in 360Ëš, offering fans front row seats to relive the highlights of the show from the convenience of their mobile devices, via a mobile app.
