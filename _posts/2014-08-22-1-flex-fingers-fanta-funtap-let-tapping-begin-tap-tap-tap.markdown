Fanta was seeking to raise brand awareness of their three main flavours amongst it's mass target audience around AP.

An addictive game concept was concepted and created, challenging players to catch falling fruit, bubbles and Fanta characters by tapping the Fanta bottles and racking up points.

Players choose from three Fanta flavours; Orange, Strawberry and Grape, each with it's own unique gameplay, representing the distinct character of each flavour.
