Mobile Now has partnered with Creative Innovator Peter Lazou to create Simple Plug & Play (SP&P).

SP&P is a unique, customisable tablet app developed to aggregate all resources that a Relationship Manager (RM) will need for an engaging and dynamic client experience.

It's single convenient interface, unshackles RMs from multiple platforms so that they can focus on making fully personalised and compelling presentations to their clients.

It's paperless, yet secure and can be updated centrally to ensure that RMs are armed with the latest facts, figures and rates across the bank's entire portfolio.
