Mobile Now has delivered an iPad mini application for British American Tobacco; streamlining the way in which consumer data is collected.

Evolving from hand written forms and name card drops, the handy sized tablet now makes data capture infinitely easier and seamless. The app links directly to central database allowing data to be saved in real time.

A clean approach to UX has been taken to ensure a smooth and quick interaction with the user. To support this a smart input system allows some fields to be auto populated, such as address. Multiple languages are also available to meet the needs of diverse markets in EU.

The tool includes a number of skins to enable various BAT brands to be representing; depending on the particular event.
