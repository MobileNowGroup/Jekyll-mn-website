International fashion retailer H&M have embraced responsive web to launch their new 2014 collection.

Built around their _H&amp;M Loves Music_ proposition, visitors can view the new collections, create downloadable and shareable lookbooks, as well as listen to exclusive tracks from a range of featured artists.

A second phase is coming next month to launch the H&M summer collection. This features an innovative music mixer, allowing visitors to remix a track via their fashion selections.
